## Hi, I'm [Ilia Ozhmegov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilia-ozhmegov/) 👋

I am a Data Scientist with both software engineering and machine learning experience in tackling complex data-related problems. I have contributed to the design and development of dozens machine learning projects, varying from video compression with a complex neural network to time-series forecasting of Bank Account Balance. 

The majority of those projects include the usage of advanced statistical learning methods on top of the natural language processing techniques. I have strong technical expertise in data science tooling, such as CLI, R, Python, SQL, Spark, as well as sound knowledge of the main AWS services. Besides my expertise spreads on the building data science infrastructure that helps to enable continuous model monitoring and maintaining.

Working with stakeholders and facilitating cross-team collaboration has been a crucial part of my experience. I enjoy working in a team and achieving results together, by sharing knowledge and collaborating closely with fellow data scientists and engineers.
